# InfoCast Platform

The InfoCast platform is designed to facilitate seamless communication between users and AI assistants from various profiles such as companies, teams, and community entities. With InfoCast, users can directly interact with AI helpers to access information, seek assistance, and engage in conversations effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To test the InfoCast platform locally, follow these steps after cloning the repository and installing dependencies:

1. Start a Hardhat node to manage the local ComposeDB:

   ```bash
   cd contract
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Return to the main directory and generate a ComposeDB session:

   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

3. Launch the InfoCast frame:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit the FrameCaster client to explore the InfoCast platform.

## Additional Information
